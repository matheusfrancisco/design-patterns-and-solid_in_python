## Learning about SOLID

* Single Responsibility Principle
```
A class should only have one reason to change
Separation of concerns - different classes handling different, independent tasks
```
* Open-Closed Principle
```
Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
```
* Liskov Substitution Principle
```
You should be able to substitue a base type for a subtype
```
* Interface Segregation Principle
```
Don't put too much into an interface; split into separete interfaces
```
* Dependency Inversion Principle
```
High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions
```
